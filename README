Dead-Reckoning
======
Nothing to see here, just move along now child.

Okay, actually this is a simple graphical Rougelike game slapped together in java. As time goes on and it fell victim to the ever looming terror that is feature creep, it has gained half-finished systems for mod loading/saving, and a rework of the Slick GameState system, called HudLayerStates.

The main contributers are PurpleTengu, TheTaoist, and Lego6245, although Purple is more or less the only one actually working on it as of now, though Lego conributes from time to time.

I swear we'll finish it eventually.

In other words, "Nothing to see here, just move along now child."
